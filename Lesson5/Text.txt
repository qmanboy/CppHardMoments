My name's David! We're in a small village near Chicago. My cousin's getting married.
My father and her father are twins. A lot of relatives are here for the wedding party.
Are we very busy? My uncle's friend is making palov. My sister Susan and Aunt Keane
are making cakes. My mother's helping her niece with her wedding dress. My grandparents
are here too. They're very old. They live in Chicago! I'm making a video and taking
photos. It's great. I want to be a reporter.
